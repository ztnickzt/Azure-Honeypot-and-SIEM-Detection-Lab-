# Azure Honeypot & SIEM Detection Lab

## Overview

Built a cloud-based Security Operations Center using Microsoft Azure, Microsoft Sentinel, and a Windows virtual machine configured as an internet-facing honeypot. The project focused on deploying cloud infrastructure, collecting Windows Security logs, analyzing failed login attempts, enriching attack data with GeoIP information, and visualizing real-world attack activity through Microsoft Sentinel.

# Project Walkthrough

## 1. Built the Azure Environment

Created a free Microsoft Azure subscription.

Deployed a Windows virtual machine to act as an internet-facing honeypot.

Configured a Network Security Group to allow inbound traffic for testing.

Disabled Windows Defender Firewall to increase exposure and generate security events.

## 2. Generated Failed Login Activity

Attempted multiple failed logins against the Windows virtual machine.

Verified Windows Security logs were generated in Event Viewer.

Confirmed failed authentication attempts appeared as **Event ID 4625**.

## 3. Configured Log Collection

Created a Log Analytics Workspace.

Enabled Microsoft Sentinel.

Connected the Windows virtual machine using the Azure Monitor Agent.

Created a Data Collection Rule to forward Windows Security Events into Log Analytics.

## 4. Investigated Security Events

Used Kusto Query Language to identify failed login attempts.

```kusto
SecurityEvent
| where EventID == 4625
```

Reviewed:

- Failed login attempts
- Usernames
- Source IP addresses
- Event timestamps



## 5. Added GeoIP Enrichment

Imported the GeoIP watchlist into Microsoft Sentinel.

Matched attacker IP addresses with geographic location data.

Enriched failed login events with country and region information.

## 6. Built an Attack Map

Created a Microsoft Sentinel Workbook.

Configured a map visualization to display failed login attempts by geographic location.

Observed real-world attack traffic targeting the Azure honeypot.
